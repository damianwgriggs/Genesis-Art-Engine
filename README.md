# The Genesis Art Engine

> *"I sought to play the god. My desire was simple: to speak a word and have the world appear."*

**The Genesis Engine** is a voice-controlled procedural art tool. It bridges the gap between the spoken word and visual reality, using **Google Gemini** as the spirit of creation and **Python** as the brush.

Unlike standard AI image generators that diffuse static noise, this engine composes the world from scratch using pure geometry. It stacks layers of semi-transparent polygons to create landscapes that breathe with light, atmosphere, and "ghost physics."

## 📜 The Grimoire (Features)

* **Voice of Creation:** Speak your vision into the microphone, and the engine interprets your intent.
* **The Universal Vector:** The engine does not use pre-made assets. It calculates the geometry of dragons, towers, and hills in real-time using mathematical coordinates.
* **Genesis Mode (Alpha Channel):** Supports 8-digit Hex codes (`#RRGGBBAA`), allowing for transparency, stained-glass lighting effects, and atmospheric depth.
* **The Chronicle:** Automatically saves every creation to a local `gallery/` folder, preserving your timeline of universes.

## 🛠️ The Ritual (Installation)

To summon the engine on your own machine, you require **Python 3.8+** and a **Google Gemini API Key**.
